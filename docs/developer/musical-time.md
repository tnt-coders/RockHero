\page guide_musical_time Musical Time and the Tempo Map

*Applies to: Repo-wide — every projection, renderer, and the audio engine consume these types.*

Timing is the heart of a rhythm game, and this codebase keeps two time domains strictly
separated: **musical positions** (measures, beats, exact rational sub-beats) are what charts
author; **seconds** are what renderers and audio consume. Exactly one type converts between them.

# The value types (`rock-hero-common/core`)

- `TimePosition` / `TimeDuration` / `TimeRange` (`timeline/timeline.h`) — seconds as strong
  types. Equality is deliberately *exact* (`std::is_eq(a <=> b)`); tolerance belongs in named
  helpers at call sites, never hidden inside `operator==`.
- `Fraction` (`timeline/fraction.h`) — a gcd-reduced rational, so subdivisions like 1/3 or 3/16
  are exact, not floating-point approximations.
- `GridPosition` (`chart/chart.h`) — `{measure, beat, Fraction offset}` with `offset ∈ [0,1)`:
  the exact musical address every authored thing uses (notes, tone boundaries, automation
  points). Fully ordered, so positions sort and compare exactly.

# The TempoMap

`TempoMap` (`timeline/tempo_map.h`) is the **sole durable timing authority**. Its authored data
is small: time-signature changes (per measure) and sparse *beat anchors* pinning specific beats
to absolute seconds. Between anchors, time interpolates linearly in **quarter-note (metronome)
time** — a meter change between anchors re-slices beat durations rather than stretching them, so
tempo changes only ever happen at anchors (the "metronome-linear" invariant).

Two performance mechanisms matter when querying it:

- Construction builds **derived index tables** once (`buildDerivedIndices()`), so queries like
  `secondsAtGlobalBeatPosition` binary-search monotonic tables instead of rescanning authored
  lists. (This is what fixed the 1/128-grid lag; do not reintroduce per-query scans.)
- For sequential scans (grid lines, projections), `TempoMap::ForwardBeatTimeCursor` resolves
  non-decreasing positions in amortized constant time, bit-identical to the random-access query.

The flow every feature follows: charts author `GridPosition` → a projection resolves seconds
through the `TempoMap` once (`highway_projection.cpp` and `tab_projection.cpp` both walk a
`ForwardBeatTimeCursor`) → renderers consume seconds only and never do musical math per frame.

# Who owns tempo truth (and the one-way mirror)

Tracktion's edit is **tempo-inert**: RockHero never reads tempo back from it. Hosted VST plugins
still need host tempo, so the engine *mirrors* the TempoMap into the edit's tempo sequence —
one-way, write-only (`src/tracktion/tempo_mirror.cpp`, entered via `Engine::mirrorTempoMap`).
Any code that reads `edit.tempoSequence` for timing is a bug by decision, not by style.

# The playback clock

Song time reaches frames through a dedicated read-only port, deliberately separate from the
side-effecting `ITransport`:

- `IPlaybackClock::snapshot()` returns `PlaybackClockSnapshot{position, capture time, rate,
  playing}` — wait-free from any thread (`AtomicPlaybackClock` stores integer nanoseconds and
  parts-per-million so every store is lock-free).
- The engine publishes boundaries on every transport event and republishes at 60 Hz while
  playing (`engine_clock.cpp`, `publishClockBoundary`).
- Consumers never use raw snapshots directly for animation: `PlaybackClockExtrapolator` advances
  the last snapshot to "now" with slew-limited correction and never moves backward during
  continuous play. The game's `FrameClock` wraps exactly this; the editor's vblank-driven views
  sample the same way.

# Grid and snapping (editor)

The editor's grid note value (a `Fraction` of a whole note, default 1/4) is the *shared
authority* for both drawing and snapping: `tempo_grid_geometry.cpp` computes visible grid lines
and `nearestTempoGridPosition(...)` returns the exact rational `GridPosition` — the same math, so
what you see is what you snap to. Ctrl bypasses to a 1/960-beat fine grid. Gestures must go
through `musicalGridPositionForX` (see \ref guide_2d_views).

*Design in flux: making the tempo map user-visible/editable is active work
(`docs/plans/in-progress/tone-track-tempo-map-plan.md`), and tempo-anchor authoring is an
unbuilt roadmap area (`docs/plans/roadmap/41-tempo-map-authoring.md`) — the model above is
stable; its editing UI is not.*
