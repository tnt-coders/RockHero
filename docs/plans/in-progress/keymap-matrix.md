## The rule this encodes

`Ctrl`'s meaning follows the **operation**, not the key:

- **Navigating** — moving the caret / extending a selection → `Ctrl` = **REACH** (coarser unit:
  measure, section, first/last row).
- **Placing / moving an object** — pointer placement, or `Alt`+arrows → `Ctrl` = **PRECISION**
  (off-grid / 1/960 fine).
- **Clicking an existing object** → `Ctrl` = **TOGGLE** selection membership.

`Alt` = the authoring gate (input mutates). `Shift` = range / extend / axis-lock. The **time
selection** is **always grid-locked** — keyboard *and* pointer, never finer than the display grid
(decision B, 2026-07-19; this **amends plan 47**, dropping its `Ctrl`-off-grid range endpoints).

## Two selection kinds, one at a time (decision A, 2026-07-19)

The single editor-wide selection is at any moment **one of two kinds** — making one clears the
other; verbs dispatch on whichever is active (no precedence):

- **Object selection** — a *set* of objects (notes / point / region). Built by click, `Ctrl`+click,
  marquee, double-click.
- **Time selection** — a grid-locked *span* (full height, can be empty). Built by `Shift`+click,
  `Shift`+arrows, ruler drag. Feeds the **loop region** (a separate persistent transport state).

## The surfaces

| Surface | What it holds | Keyboard model |
|---|---|---|
| **Chart** (the note highway) | notes on strings | caret (point) |
| **Automation lanes** | parameter points | caret (point) |
| **Tone strip** | tone regions | **selectable region-row** — keyboard-navigable (select the region at the cursor's time); span-selection, *not* point-placement |
| **Plugin chain** (bottom panel) | the current tone's plugins | slot-focus (`✚ proposed`) — signal-order, no time caret |

## Legends

**Surface cell:** *text* = the behavior on that surface · `✓` = bound & identical to the others ·
`✗` = **not bound** on that surface · `—` = that surface has no such object (n/a).

**Status:** *(none)* = Live today · `Δ` = shipped but this scheme changes it · `✚` = new this
session (unbuilt) · `◇` = open, needs your call · `▷N` = in plan N (47 loop · 52 range · 40 chart ·
46 registry).

## Navigation — caret

Point-caret lives on chart + lanes; the tone strip participates as a selectable **region-row** (no point-caret) — see *Tone-region row*.

| Keybind | Chart (highway) | Automation lanes | Tone strip | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `←` / `→` | → next stop (grid **or** note) | → next stop (grid **or** point) | `✗` | Live |
| `Ctrl+←/→` | → **measure** jump | → **measure** jump | `✗` | Live |
| `↑` / `↓` | → adjacent string (crosses into lanes at the edge) | → adjacent lane (crosses into strings at the edge) | `✗` | Live |
| `Ctrl+↑/↓` | → adjacent **surface** (chart ↔ tone-region ↔ lanes) | → adjacent **surface** | → region-row | `Δ` (replaces the dead first/last-row no-op) |
| `PageUp` / `PageDn` | → prev / next **section** | → prev / next **section** | `✗` | Live (ae0e7ad5; Ctrl rides along as an alias — accepted 2026-07-20) |
| `Home` / `End` | → chart **start / end** | → chart **start / end** | `✗` | Live (ae0e7ad5) |
| `Ctrl+Home` / `Ctrl+End` | chart start / end (alias) | chart start / end (alias) | `✗` | Live (ae0e7ad5) |

## Time selection (one full-height span — crosses every surface, so not per-surface)

| Keybind | Behavior | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `Shift+←/→` | extend time-range by the **display grid** | Live (759b145f) |
| `Shift+Ctrl+←/→` | extend time-range by **measure** | Live (759b145f) |
| `Shift+PageUp/Dn` | extend time-range by **section** | Live (759b145f) |
| `Shift+Home` / `Shift+End` | extend time-range to chart **start / end** | Live (759b145f) |
| `Shift+↑/↓` | *(nothing — the range is full-height; no vertical extension)* | `—` unbound (confirmed) |

*(759b145f ships conservative defaults on the unsigned sub-decisions — accepted 2026-07-20 as
placeholders until plan 52's range verbs land: typing with a range is inert (52-Q11), Delete over
a range is a no-op pending plan 52's content-delete, and the extend is paused-only.)*

## Authoring — move / resize / fret (acts on the object selection)

| Keybind | Chart (highway) | Automation lanes | Tone strip | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Alt+←/→` | move note(s) in time (grid) | move point in time (grid) | `✗` (no keyboard) | Live |
| `Ctrl+Alt+←/→` | move **1/960 fine** | move **1/960 fine** | `✗` | Live |
| `Alt+↑/↓` | move across **strings** | move **value** | `✗` | Live |
| **`Ctrl+Alt+↑/↓`** | **`✗` (strings are discrete — no fine)** | **move fine value** | `✗` | Live |
| `Shift+Alt+←/→` | resize **sustain** (grid) | `—` (points have no extent) | `✗` (pointer edge-drag instead) | Live |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+←/→` | resize sustain **fine** | `—` | `✗` | Live |
| `Shift+Alt+↑/↓` | **fret shift** ±1 | `—` (no frets) | `✗` | Live |

*(The `Ctrl+Alt+↑/↓` row is your example, now explicit: bound on lanes, unbound on the highway.)*

## Payload entry

| Keybind | Behavior | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `Space` | play / pause from the marker | Live |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | undo / redo (exact-modifier matched); `Ctrl+Shift+Z` = redo alias — **fully rebindable** with `Space` (fixed-trio decision reversed 2026-07-20; rebinds mirror into plugin windows via the generalized layout-neutral seam) | Live (registry + mirror sync 2026-07-20; manual plugin verification passed 2026-07-20) |

## Tone-region row (keyboard) — `✚ proposed`

The tone strip joins the vertical stack as a **single selectable region-row** (between the chart
strings and the automation lanes): dropping onto it **selects the tone region at the cursor's
time** — a span-selection, not a point-caret, so it respects the strip's span nature (you never
caret-place a tone point). The arrow stack is **chart strings ↔ tone-region ↔ automation lanes** —
plain `↑/↓` walk every row, `Ctrl+↑/↓` jump surface-to-surface (they converge on the single tone
row, a harmless seam effect, like plain `←`/`Ctrl+←` at a measure start). The **signal chain is not
in the arrow flow** — it's reached only by `Enter` (below), so `↓`/`Ctrl+↓` stop at the last lane.

With a tone region selected:
- `←/→` = move the time caret; crossing a boundary re-selects the region you're over — this is how you keyboard-pick a split location.
- `Insert` = split at the caret + open the tone picker (no neutral tone). Coexists with `Ctrl+T`, which inserts at the *playhead* from any surface (E2) — the two target different positions.
- `Shift+Alt+←/→` = **resize** the region (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt` = fine) — Gap 5.
- `Delete` = delete the selected change (merge into the previous region) — the unified selection-dispatched Delete.
- `Enter` = drill into the **signal chain** to edit that tone; **`Esc` returns** to the region (re-selected). Inside the chain `↑/↓` are inert — `Esc` is the way out.

This narrows the earlier "tone strip is keyboard-dead / pointer-only" to **"no point-placement
caret"** — region *selection* and its verbs are keyboard-reachable; point authoring still isn't.

---

## Automation lanes — creating a lane, and the empty case (`✚ proposed`)

An automation lane's identity is a **plugin parameter**, not a grid position — so there is no empty
"lane slot" to `Insert` into the way a note has an empty grid slot; creating a lane means *picking a
parameter to automate*. To keep that keyboard-reachable and avoid a jarring skip when a tone has no
lanes yet, the automation surface always carries a focusable **"+ add automation" row** (present
whether the tone has zero lanes or ten):

- Descending the stack (`↑/↓` or `Ctrl+↑/↓`) lands on the automation surface's first lane, **or on
  the "+ add" row when there are none** — it never silently skips past an empty automation surface.
- Plain `↑/↓` walk the lanes *and* the "+ add" row.
- On the "+ add" row, `Enter`/`Insert` opens a **plugin → parameter picker**; choosing one opens the
  lane and lands you on it. (Inside a lane, `Insert` keeps its normal meaning — create a point.)
- Edge: if the tone has **no plugins**, there is nothing to automate — the "+ add" row says so and
  points to the chain.

The plugin-centric path — `Ctrl+↑` from a selected plugin reveals (or offers to create) *that
plugin's* lanes — is filed under the deferred **targeted drill**; both can coexist later.

---

## Plugin chain (keyboard) — `✚ proposed`

The signal-chain panel (`SignalChainView`, bottom of the editor) already exists but is pointer-only;
this adds a keyboard model to it. It is a **slot** axis (signal order), not a time axis, so it has
**no time caret** — time stays owned by the timeline caret, and *which* tone's chain you edit follows
the playhead. Keyboard tone/plugin editing lives **here**, which is why the tone strip stays
pointer-only.

**Entering / leaving:** `Enter` on a selected **tone region** drills into that tone's chain (first
plugin); **`Esc` returns** to the tone region. The chain is *not* in the arrow flow — `Ctrl+↓` from
the lanes does not reach it, and `↑/↓` are inert inside it (no vertical axis). Entering **parks the
shared time caret (passive)** and hands the arrows to a **slot-focus**. The selected plugin slot is a
**mutually-exclusive variant of the one editor-wide selection** — selecting a plugin clears any
note/point/region selection, and vice-versa.

| Keybind | Behavior | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `←` / `→` | navigate plugin **slots** | `✚` |
| `Alt+←/→` | **reorder** — move the plugin slot-to-slot (reuses the pointer `MovePlugin` edit) | `✚` |
| `Enter` | **open** the plugin window; on an empty slot, falls back to the picker | `✚` |
| `Insert` | open the plugin **picker** — empty slot → **create**; filled slot → **replace** (confirmation prompt before overwriting) | `✚` |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | **remove** the plugin (reuses the pointer `RemovePlugin` edit) — **with a confirmation prompt** | `✚` |

Reorder and delete route through the **existing pointer-path edits**, so the cascade (a plugin owns
its automation lanes) and single-entry undo are inherited unchanged — the keyboard is only a new
front-end, undo behavior is unaffected. The delete confirmation is justified not by data loss (undo
restores it) but because **undo reloads the plugin, which is slow**.

**`Insert` on a filled slot = replace — a deliberate, scoped exception** to the editor-wide "`Insert`
never mutates an existing object." The exception is principled: on the other surfaces `Insert`-on-
occupied has no *useful* meaning (you change a note by retyping its fret, so `Insert` there would
just redundantly zero it; an automation point has nothing to overwrite). A plugin is the one object
where the occupied action *is* useful and common — swapping one pedal for another shouldn't require
a two-step delete-then-add — so on a filled slot `Insert` opens the picker and, once you choose the
replacement, prompts for confirmation before overwriting. `Enter` stays *open the window*, never
replace. *(When this folds into `editing-interaction-model.md`, the settled Insert rule gets this
chain-scoped exception noted alongside it.)*

**Future enhancements (revisit after the current keybinds settle):**
- **Bypass / enable toggle** — A/B a plugin without deleting it (agreed essential; a new state-toggle verb-class, needs a `PluginBypassEdit`).
- `Ctrl+D` **duplicate** the selected plugin (state included).
- `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` **copy/paste** a plugin — or a whole chain — across tones (needs an editor clipboard).
- `Ctrl+↑` from a selected plugin surfaces **that plugin's** automation lanes (targeted drill, closing the chain↔lanes loop).
- `Ctrl+Alt+←/→` = **move-to-end** (or leave `✗`, uniform with the discrete strings row).
- Chain-level **A/B snapshot** compare.

---

## What the surface columns expose

Reading down the columns, the divergences separate into two kinds:

**Consistent specialization — same verb, the row's native data (leave as-is):**
`0`–`9`, `Insert`, `Alt+↑/↓`, `Delete`, `Alt`+click, click/double-click — fret vs value vs point vs
region are just what each surface's objects *are*.

**By design (not a gap):** the **tone strip has no point-placement caret** — it's a span surface, so
keyboard access is *region-selection*, not point-authoring: it's a selectable **region-row** in the
vertical stack (select/resize/`Enter`-to-chain/delete the region at the cursor), and point-level tone
editing lives on the **plugin chain**. See *Tone-region row*.

**Real gaps / inconsistencies (parity work for the plan, not keymap decisions):**
- **`Ctrl+Alt+↑/↓`** — fine value on lanes, `✗` on the highway (strings are discrete).
- **Multi-select is chart-only** — `Ctrl`+click toggle and marquee are `✗` on lanes and tone.
- **Drag-move / edge-resize** — live on lanes/tone, **parked** on the chart.
- **`Alt`+wheel duration** and its fine/fret variants — chart-only.
- **Right-click menu** — missing on the chart.
- **Extent-resize is split three ways** — chart keyboard (`Shift+Alt`), tone pointer edge-drag, lanes none.

## Surface parity triage (decision 5-B — deciding each gap individually)

Each coverage gap gets decided explicitly: **close** (schedule the parity work) or **intentional**
(document the per-surface difference as deliberate). Working through them one at a time:

1. Chart pointer drag-editing — **CLOSE: drag-move only** (reposition a note by mouse; plain = grid, `Ctrl` = off-grid). **Sustain edge-drag dropped** — `Alt`+wheel is already the mouse sustain command, so an edge-drag would be redundant. · **scheduled**
2. Right-click on the chart — **CLOSE: build it as a keybind-discovery menu** listing every applicable action + its **live keybind** (context-sensitive). Reframes the menu from "redundant action path" to "teach the shortcuts." Applies to **all surfaces'** menus for consistency; best built on plan 46's command registry (JUCE surfaces the current shortcut per item automatically). Supersedes the "deferred until techniques" note. · **scheduled**
3. Multi-select on automation lanes — **CLOSE: `Ctrl`+click toggle + marquee** for points (join the object-selection like notes). Use case: select a run of points and bump the whole shape across a grid line together. · **scheduled**
4. Multi-select on the tone strip — **INTENTIONAL: leave single-select.** Tone changes are sparse and rarely bulk-edited; single-select matches the strip's already-distinct sparse/structural, pointer-only nature. Documented as deliberate, not a gap. · **intentional**
5. Extent-resize on tone regions — **CLOSE: keyboard `Shift+Alt+←/→` resize + `Ctrl+Shift+Alt` fine**, via a new selectable **tone-region row** in the vertical stack (select the region at the cursor's time). Lanes stay `—` (no extent). This also brings the tone strip into keyboard nav — see *Tone-region row* below. · **scheduled**

## Fold-in issue resolutions (settled while folding rules into the design docs, 2026-07-20)

The rule fold-in surfaced conflicts needing a call. Resolutions as they settle:

- **A — DECIDED (A2): the plugin chain is a separate modal focus scope, NOT part of the one
  editor-wide selection.** The timeline keeps its flat one-selection; the chain is a modal
  sub-editor (`Enter`-in / `Esc`-out) with its own focus and verb set (`Delete` = remove plugin,
  `←/→` = slots, `Enter` = open, `Insert` = picker). "One selection editor-wide" is reworded to
  "one *timeline* selection + a separate chain focus" — the no-ambiguity benefit is preserved (the
  active scope determines what `Delete` hits). Drilling in **parks** the timeline selection (`Esc`
  restores it); clicking a plugin does not clear the timeline selection; reveal-on-undo may pull
  focus into the chain. Do **not** add a `PluginSlotSelection` to `EditorSelection`. **Links to G —
  the loud active-scope indicator is now a hard requirement.**
- **B — POSTPONED to last.** The tone-region row's marker semantics (armed caret riding a *span*,
  the clear-rule split, the string↔tone↔lane seams) need every keybind on that surface considered
  together — revisit after the rest are settled.
- **C — DECIDED: strict grid-lock + operation-`Ctrl` carried through.** The ruler drag is a
  *selection*, not a placement, so it uses grid-locked selection semantics rather than
  `placementModeFor` (amends plan 47 decision 5 — no "second mapping" issue, since placement and
  selection are different operations under the partition). **C-i (a):** `Ctrl+ruler-drag` =
  measure-snap (reach; pointer twin of `Shift+Ctrl+arrow`). **C-ii:** a time-selection started from
  an off-grid caret snaps its anchor to the grid (range starts at the caret's grid cell; the
  off-grid note stays *inside* the range) — accepted discontinuity. Execution: amend plan 47 (drop
  `Ctrl`-off-grid endpoints), rewrite "`Ctrl` = precision everywhere" → operation partition,
  re-check plan 46's fixed-vocabulary note.
- **D — DECIDED: mutual exclusivity.** Object-selection and time-selection are two
  mutually-exclusive kinds of the one selection — never both live; selecting one clears the other;
  no precedence ladder. Resolves plan 52's Q6 (moot), Q10 (a time range dissolves the object
  selection/caret), Q12 (moot); overrides plan 52's "complements, not competitors" language (update
  plan 52). The loop region stays a separate persistent transport state (unaffected). Structural
  landing: add a `TimeSelection` variant to `EditorSelection`, reconciled with plan 47's
  `LoopSelectionViewState`.
- **E — DECIDED (E2): keep `Ctrl+T`.** `Ctrl+T` = insert a tone change at the **playhead** from any
  surface (a from-anywhere accelerator, and the first of the insert-at-playhead family for future
  anchors/notes); it coexists with the tone-row `Insert` at the **caret** — different target
  positions. Fix the `Ctrl+Alt+T` bug by **guarding `Ctrl+T` against `Alt`** (require `Ctrl` and
  not `Alt`), NOT by removal. *(Reverses the earlier "Ctrl+T retired" note.)*
- **F — DECIDED: one named exception + create framing.** "Insert never mutates an existing object"
  gains exactly ONE named exception — a *filled plugin slot* (replace-with-confirm). The tone-row
  `Insert`-split is framed as a **create** (a new tone change at an empty region-interior; the
  objects are the boundaries, interiors are the empty gaps between them; `Insert` on an existing
  boundary no-ops) — so it stays *inside* the rule, no exception. Update the verb table + §9b together.
- **G — DECIDED: loud active-scope indicator (required by A2) + `Enter` escalation.** While the chain
  holds focus: a loud focus ring on the selected slot, the chain panel reads "active"
  (highlighted header/border), the timeline visibly de-emphasized. `←/→` is documented as
  scope-dependent (chart/lanes/tone row = time caret; chain = slots). `Enter` escalates by drilling
  (tone region → chain → plugin window); `Esc` unwinds one level.
- **H — folded in as cleanup (no decision):** re-home/drop the deferred "GP-style `+/-` sustain-entry"
  note (`+/-` is now grid), and reconcile the `docs/tracking/watch-items.md` "sustain tail-drag"
  entry (the edge-drag is dropped; `Alt`+wheel covers it).

## Verdict record — all decided (sign-off completed 2026-07-20)

1. **DECIDED (A) — bind `Ctrl+Home`/`Ctrl+End` as chart-bound aliases.** A held-`Ctrl` navigation that does nothing reads as a broken editor — more confusing than a harmless duplicate; remap if a genuine use appears later.
2. **DECIDED (C) — GP-style zoom/grid.** `+/-` (main `=/-`, `Shift+=`, numpad) = **grid**; `Ctrl`+`+/-` = **zoom**; the wheel stays zoom (plain + `Ctrl`+wheel). `[ ]` freed. Matches GP + browser and dissolves the fine-zoom/browser collision (`Ctrl+=` = normal zoom, not fine). *(Grid direction confirmed 2026-07-20: `+` = finer.)*
3. **DECIDED (A) — `Shift+↑/↓` unbound.** The time selection is full-height, so there's no vertical axis to extend along; overloading it for object-multi-select would fracture the object-vs-time split. Stays free.
4. **DECIDED (B) — strict grid-lock.** *All* time-selection is grid-locked (keyboard **and** pointer); a range boundary can never be off-grid. **Amends plan 47** (drop its `Ctrl`-off-grid range endpoints). A copied range still captures off-grid *content* inside it — only the boundaries snap — so copy/paste always lands clean.
5. **DECIDED (B) — triage each gap individually** (close vs document-as-intentional, deciding each case explicitly). Per-gap outcomes tracked in *Surface parity triage* below.
6. **DECIDED 2026-07-20 — Undo/Redo/Play-Pause are non-rebindable core commands** (dissolving 46-Q3). `Ctrl+Shift+Z` joins as a first-class redo alias (DAW muscle memory). **REVERSED the same day** after the mirror-constraint correction (the user's REAPER counterexample): the trio is fully rebindable, and rebinds mirror into plugin windows through the generalized layout-neutral injection seam (plan 46 Phase 4 execution record).
7. **DECIDED 2026-07-20 — sign-off flags all accepted**: the `Ctrl+PageUp/Dn` ride-along alias, the `Shift+-` grid match, `+` = finer, and 759b145f's conservative time-selection defaults (placeholders pending plan 52).
