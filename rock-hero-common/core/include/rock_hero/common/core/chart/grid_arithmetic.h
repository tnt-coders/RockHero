\brief Advances a grid position by an exact number of beats.

Whole beats carry across beat and measure boundaries through the tempo map's time-signature
segments (a beat is one signature beat, so crossing a meter change re-slices exactly the way the
map's beat axis does); the fractional remainder becomes the resulting sub-beat offset. Negative
deltas move earlier; a result that would land before the grid origin clamps to measure 1 beat 1
with a zero offset. Positions past the terminal anchor keep extending — signatures carry forward.

\param tempo_map Tempo map supplying the signature-derived beat axis.
\param position Valid grid position to advance (offset in [0, 1)).
\param beats Signed exact beat delta.
\return The advanced position, clamped at the grid origin.

\brief Measures the signed exact beat distance from one grid position to another.

The inverse of advanceGridPosition: advancing `from` by the returned distance reaches `to`
exactly. Positive when `to` is later than `from`.

\param tempo_map Tempo map supplying the signature-derived beat axis.
\param from Position the distance is measured from.
\param to Position the distance is measured to.

\brief Resolves the grid position where a note's sustain ends.

A zero sustain ends at the onset itself. Sustains may cross beat, measure, and signature
boundaries; the endpoint is exact.

\param tempo_map Tempo map supplying the signature-derived beat axis.
\param note Chart note whose sustain endpoint is wanted.
\return The onset advanced by the note's sustain.

\brief Snaps a grid position to the nearest line of the measure-anchored note-value grid.

Same grid semantics as the editor timeline's rendered grid and time-space snap
(`nearestTempoGridPosition`): the note value is a fraction of a whole note (1/8 means eighth
notes in every meter), lines sit every step from each measure's downbeat with the count
restarting at the next downbeat, every downbeat is a line even when the measure length is not a
multiple of the step, ties resolve to the earlier line, and the result stores the line's exact
rational position. Callers own note-value validity policy (the editor validates with
`isValidTempoGridNoteValue` and falls back to 1/4); a non-positive note value or degenerate
signature returns the position unchanged.

\param tempo_map Tempo map supplying signatures and the beat grid.
\param position Valid grid position to snap (offset in [0, 1)).
\param note_value Grid step as a fraction of a whole note; must be positive.
\return The exact position of the nearest grid line.
